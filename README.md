When the page loads, the user will need to enter Pokemon ID that corresponds to a
pokemon. Donâ€™t worry about validating the IDs being entered, just expect that no
data will be retrieved.
Upon pressing the Retrieve button, the Pokemon Number, Name, Height, Weight,
and Image will all be populated on the screen.
